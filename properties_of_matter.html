        <p>As an aspiring mechanical engineer with an interest in chemestry, I am passionate about how the intersection of these fields can lead innovative solutions, particulary in the design of engine components in my future career.</p>
        <h2> 
            Physical Properties
        </h2>
        <p> When working on engines, I will be looking at things like how heavy or how well a material handles heat. Choosing lighter materials can make engines more fuel-efficient, while materials that handle heat well can keep engine running safely and for longer.By applying the Physical Properties that I lave learned in this class, I can design engines that are not only powerful but also efficient and durable.</p>
        <h2>Chemical Properties</h2>
        <p>Chemical Properties are very important while designing things.This will help me choose materials that won't rust or wear out quickly when exposed to fuels and other chemicals.This is important because it means the parts will last longer and require less maintenance. By Using my knowledge of what I have learned in this class I can select material that stand up to tough conditions, making engines more reliable and eco-freindly. .</p>
